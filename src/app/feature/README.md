# Feature Layer

Each directory inside `feature` represents a **complete business feature**.

## Principles
- Feature isolation
- Vertical slicing
- Independent evolution

## What a feature contains
- Domain logic
- Application use cases
- UI components

## Why this exists
FOTCHA is **feature-oriented**, not layer-oriented.

Instead of grouping by file type,
we group by **business capability**.
